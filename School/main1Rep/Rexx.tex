\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\section{Introduction}
\begin{justify}
Data centers play a vital role in today’s digital economy, providing the infrastructure necessary for the storage, management, and distribution of vast amounts of data. With businesses, governments, and individuals relying heavily on digital services, the need for secure, dependable, and scalable data centers has increased significantly.\\
Mr. Maurice commenced our tour by providing an overview of the data centre’s extensive
hosting capabilities, which serve a variety of industries, including financial institutions. The
facility is classified as a Tier 3 data centre by the Uptime Institute, a distinction earned due to
its robust power infrastructure and stringent maintenance protocols.\\
The centre’s reliability is bolstered by its dual power supply system: one stream powers
primary operations, while the other is dedicated to cooling and backup. To ensure continuous service, the facility features two transformers, electricity from the Electricity Company of
Ghana (ECG), backup generators, and an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).
\end{justify}
\subsection{Brief\hspace{0.5cm}on\hspace{0.5cm}Data\hspace{0.5cm}Centers}
\begin{justify}
A data center is a dedicated facility that hosts critical computing systems like servers, networking devices, and storage. It acts as a hub where businesses manage, store, and process large
volumes of data, ensuring the reliability and security of information across multiple industries.
\end{justify}

%------chapter 2
\chapter{NETWORK MANAGEMENT}
\section{Network\hspace{0.5cm}Management}\begin{flushleft}
	Mr. Mawuli explained the key elements of network management, including fire protection,
	power, cooling, and connectivity, which add security and value for customers. The ISO 27001-
	certified, Tier 3 facility ensures ”99.99\% availability.” We toured the loading bay, where combustible materials are stored separately to reduce fire risks, and the ”Meet Me Room” (MMR
	B), a connection hub for customers and service providers. Critical areas feature industrial air
	conditioning to prevent electrostatic discharge, while the Optical Distribution Frame (ODF) and
	IP rack Cisco Nessus 70010 provide redundant customer connections.\\[0.3cm]


\subsection{Tier 3 Infrastructure}
\begin{justify}
	A Tier 3 data centres offer 99.99\% availability, ensuring minimal downtime—less than 1.6
	hours per year. This classification ensures that the data center can undergo maintenance without
	disrupting service, as it includes multiple power and cooling paths, ensuring redundancy. In the
	event of a power failure, the system switches to alternative sources, such as UPS or generators,
	to maintain operations. This level of reliability is crucial for businesses that cannot afford
	significant service interruptions.
\end{justify}

\chapter{DATA HALL}

\subsection{Temperature Regulation}
\begin{justify}
	Mr. Denis guided us through the data hall, which employs advanced cooling systems, including
	Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units. Five units are needed for full load operation,
	with one serving as backup, though only two were running during our visit.
	The hall uses containment systems to separate hot and cold air. Servers in hot aisles push
	heat through vents, which is recycled to regulate cooling needs. The power supply is split between two sources via Power Distribution Units (PDUs) connected by bus bars. FM200 gas
	provides fire suppression, while the ventilation and extractor systems maintain optimal temperature levels.
\end{justify}
\subsection{ FM 200 Gas}
\begin{justify}
	FM 200 gas is a widely used fire suppression agent in data centers. It is a colorless, odorless
	gas that quickly extinguishes fires by removing heat or free radicals in a flame, thereby stopping
	combustion. In the data center, FM 200 is used in conjunction with fire detection systems to
	respond rapidly in case of fire, without damaging sensitive equipment. Unlike water-based
	systems, FM 200 does not leave any residue and is safe for use in areas with electronics anddelicate systems. This makes it ideal for protecting the servers, networking equipment, and
	power units within the data hall.
\end{justify}
\subsection{ Power Distribution Unit (PDU)}
\begin{justify}
	 A Power Distribution Unit (PDU) is a critical component in the data center’s power management
	 system. PDUs are responsible for distributing electrical power to servers, networking devices,
	 and other equipment. In the data hall, there are two main PDUs, labeled PDU A and PDU B,
	 which provide redundant power supplies. This dual setup ensures that in the event one PDU
	 fails, the other can continue providing uninterrupted power. The PDUs draw power from the
	 main power sources, such as UPS and generators, and distribute it to the bus bars and equipment
	 racks, ensuring stable and continuous operations across the facility.
\end{justify}
%chapter ---- 4
\chapter{ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING ROOM}
\subsection{Electrical Engineering Room}
\begin{justify}
	Electrical room plays a vital role in the overall functioning of the data center, housing the essential components that manage and distribute power throughout the facility. It is designed
	to ensure a seamless and uninterrupted power supply, safeguarding the data center’s operations from power outages and other electrical issues. The electrical room ensures uninterrupted
	power supply, featuring a DC MSB panel, UPS system, MCCB, and Sterling Generators for efficient power distribution, immediate for long-term backup, ensuring each section of the facility
	receives stable and reliable power respectively
\end{justify}
\subsection{ Power Distribution}
\begin{justify}
	Each section of the data center has a dedicated power supply managed from the electrical room.
	The room is responsible for ensuring that power is distributed efficiently and reliably to different areas of the facility, from the servers to the cooling systems and security controls. This
	ensures that all critical operations within the data center remain functional, even during power
	fluctuations or outages.
\end{justify}
\subsection{MCCB (Molded Case Circuit Breaker)}
\begin{justify}
	The electrical room is also equipped with a Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB), which is
	used to monitor and control electrical faults. The MCCB is designed to automatically detect any
	abnormalities in the electrical system, such as overloads or short circuits, and shut off power to
	prevent further damage. This system not only enhances the safety of the data center but also
	ensures that any electrical issues are quickly addressed, minimizing the risk of disruptions.
\end{justify}
\chapter{SERVICE YARD AND POWER
	MANAGEMENT}
	\subsection{Service Yard}
	\begin{justify}
		The service yard visit was a detailed lesson in power management, where we observed the
		Apollonia Connect bulk litter system.Power enters the facility through an 11KV line, which
		is stepped down to 24V by an on-load tap changer transformer.This process ensures power is
		distributed efficiently across the entire data center, contributing to its Tier 3 reliability.
	\end{justify}
\subsection{ Power Management}
\begin{justify}
	 The Sterling Generator is a key power backup solution used in the data center to ensure continuous operation in the event of a power failure. It is designed to activate automatically when the
	 main power supply from the grid fails, providing a reliable alternative power source to keep the
	 facility running. The generator is integrated into the data center’s overall power infrastructure,
	 which includes UPS systems and transformers, to ensure seamless transitions during outages.
	 Sterling Generators are known for their efficiency, durability, and ability to handle heavy loads,
	 making them essential for maintaining the up-time and operational stability of the data center.
	 By utilizing this generator, the data center minimizes the risk of downtime, safeguarding both
	 the infrastructure and the data stored within.
\end{justify}
\subsection{Building Management System}
\begin{justify}
	 The Building Management System (BMS) monitors the overall environment with 43 cameras
	 and Very Early Smoke Detector Apparatus (VESDA) systems. The facility is equipped with 43
	 cameras, most of which are positioned in the data hall to eliminate blind spots. The centre also
	 uses double-knock fire alarms and air samplers to detect any potential hazards early on.
	 In conclusion, the visit to the data centre was insightful, showcasing its robust infrastructure,
	 high standards of security, and efficient power management. The knowledge gained from understanding how the centre operates will be invaluable for future projects involving data hosting
	 and network management.
