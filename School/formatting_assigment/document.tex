	\section{Background to the Study}
	The growing demand for sustainable environmental practices in the production process of goods and services has now become a subject of global concern due to the ever-increasing cases of global warming and greenhouse effects. The global greenhouse emission as reported by the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows that the industrial and electricity sector jointly contributed 46\% of the global greenhouse emission. 24\% was from the agricultural sector, 14\% and 6\% was from transportation and building respectively. The remaining 10\% was from other sectors as shown in Figure 1.1.
